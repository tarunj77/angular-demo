                        and without notice, change or add to the Website or the information, products or services described
                        in it. However, we do not undertake to keep the Website updated. We are not liable to you or anyone
                        else if any error occurs in the information on the Website or if that information is not current.

                        <h3>3. Eligibility</h3>
                        You will not use the Website if you: are not able to form legally binding contracts; are under the age of 16; a person barred
                        from receiving and rendering services under the laws of USA or other applicable jurisdiction; are
                        suspended from using the Website; or do not hold a valid email address. All free user accounts are
                        associated with individuals. Login credentials should not be shared by users with others. The individual
                        associated with the account will be held responsible for all actions taken by the account, without
                        limitation. Subject to your local laws, a person over 15 but under 18 can use an adult's account
                        with the permission of the account holder. However, the account holder is responsible for all actions
                        taken by the account, without limitation. Users may provide a business name or a company name, which
                        is associated with the User's Account. Users acknowledge and agree that where a business name or
                        company name is associated with their Account, this User Agreement is a contract with the User as
                        an individual (not the business or company) and Users remain solely responsible for all activity
                        undertaken in respect of their Account. A company, corporation, trust, partnership or other non-individual
                        corporate entity may be a User subject to an eligible corporate account which pays corporate subscriptions.
                        We may, at our absolute discretion, refuse to register any person or entity as a User. You cannot
                        transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under this agreement without prior written
                        consent.

                        It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged intellectual property rights infringement. Our Copyright Infringement
                        Policy is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as
                        possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to
                        understand or verify. If you believe that your Intellectual Property Rights have been violated, please
                        notify us via this link on our Website and we will investigate.
                        <h3>6. Fees and Services</h3>
                        We charge fees for certain services, such as introduction fees for Projects, listing upgrades and memberships. When you use
                        a service that has a fee, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be
                        charged based on our schedule of Fees and Charges, which we may change from time to time and will
                        update by placing on our Website. We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for
                        promotional events (for example, discounts on memberships) or new services, and such changes are
                        effective when we post a temporary promotional event or new service on the Websites, or as notified
                        through promotional correspondence. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in United States
                        Dollars.
                        <h4>0% Fees Promotion</h4>
                        Project commissions charged for Sellers who refer new Buyers that do not have an existing account on Hirefox and who join
                        and create a new account, will be reduced from 10% to 0%, for all future Projects performed by the
                        referring Seller (“Referrer”) for the referred Buyer (“Referee”). This is subject to the following
                        conditions: Referees must be referred using the specific promotional links on our website published
                        time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, the reduced Project commission of 0 % applies only in relation
                        to new work performed by the Referrer who has successfully applied for this promotion for the specific
                        Referee to whom the application relates.The new Projects must commence after the Buyer creates a

                        promotion is based on existing users of the website (“Referrers”) referring new Buyer users (“Referees”)
                        to post their first Project. This is subject to the following conditions: The Referrer must be an
                        existing user of the Website. Referees must be referred using the specific promotional links on our
                        website or via links in email or other promotional correspondence specific to this promotion. Referees
                        will receive site credit upon creation of a new account as a Buyer user, which may only be applied
                        to a milestone payment for a new Project or prize for a new Contest and cannot be withdrawn. The
                        Project or Contest must have a total value greater than the credit given. Referrers who work on such
                        a Project or Contest and who receive a milestone payment may then withdraw the value of any such
                        payment. Any credits related to this promotion may expire at any time determined by the Company but
                        will expire no later than 30 days after they have been created. For the avoidance of doubt, the value
                        of the site credit applies only in relation to the establishment of milestones for a new Project,
                        or prize for a new Contest, and where the Referee user has successfully applied for this promotion.The
                        new Project(s) must commence after the Referee creates a new account on Hirefox and be initiated
                        using that new account. Referrers will receive credit when the relevant matching Referee user fully
                        releases a milestone payment with respect to a new Project, or awards the prize with respect to a
                        new Contest. This site credit may only be used for the purpose of establishing a milestone payment,
                        funding a prize for a new Contest, or payment of site Project or Contest fees. For the avoidance
                        of doubt this credit cannot be withdrawn as cash, or used for membership subscriptions or exams.

                        solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not,
                        you may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including
                        common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer

                        <h3>16. Special Provisions for Local Jobs</h3>
                        Each User acknowledges: Hirefox does not review, approve, recommend or verify any of the credentials, licences or statements
                        of capability in relation to Local Jobs (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any non Local Jobs on the
                        Website); Hirefox provides matchmaking and platform services only. Users agree that Hirefox has no
                        liability for any other aspect of service delivery or interaction between Buyer and Seller. Hirefox
                        is not a party to any disputes between Buyer and Seller, although we provide a dispute resolution
                        mechanism to assist the parties in resolving issues; Hirefox may from time to time include map features
                        and Hirefox may display the location of Users to persons browsing the Website on that map. Every
                        Buyer seeking services for Local Jobs will be asked to provide the location where the Local Job is
                        to be performed. You expressly agree that Hirefox has no liability for displaying such information.
                        A User must never disclose, in any Project posted, personal details such as the User's name, street
                        number, phone number or the email address in any Project description for a Local Job or in any other
                        public communication on the Website (these may be disclosed for Local Jobs as required in private
                        direct messages); Hirefox may collect location related data from you via technologies including but
                        not limited to GPS, IP address location, wifi, and other methods. This data may be shared in the
                        context of facilitating services for Local Jobs and each User specifically consents to this collection
                        and sharing as part of this agreement; Upon completion of a Local Job Project, Seller User must log
                        on to the Website and click the "Complete" button for that Local Job, as soon as practicable. Failure
                        to complete the service or task will constitute a breach of this User Agreement; and Our fees are
                        applied to the amount of the awarded Seller's bid to perform the services for the Local Job. Any
                        items purchased by the Seller as part of performing the service are between the Buyer and Seller.
                        <h3>17. Funds</h3>
                        You may have positive funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you
                        via the Website. If you are a Seller, you may have positive funds if you have successfully completed
                        a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where
                        funds may have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.
                        Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with financial institutions.
                        Funds in your Account are not held separately by us, and may be commingled with our general operating
                        funds, and/or funds of other User's Accounts. You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings
                        for funds that are in your Account. We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating
                        accounts from financial institutions with whom we hold our operating accounts. Any such interest
                        earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.
                        If your Account has negative funds, we may: set-off the negative amount with funds that you subsequently
                        receive into your Account; if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the
                        currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set - off the negative amount against funds you
                        maintain in a different currency (at an exchange rate applied by us); reverse payments you have made
                        from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website; deduct amounts you owe us from money you
                        subsequently add or receive into your Account; or immediately suspend or limit your Account until
                        such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount. In the event that we offset a negative
                        amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your
                        Account. We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means. You acknowledge
                        and agree that: we are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking
                        services or any financial services to you; the funds shown in your Account (which may include Milestone
                        Payments and/or any prepayment of fees and charges which you owe to us) represents our unsecured
                        obligations to you with respect to your rights to direct us to make payment in relation to the purchase
                        and sale of Seller Services through the Website and provision of the Hirefox Services; if you were
                        a User acquired in an acquisition and your account was migrated to the Website, we are responsible
                        for your positive funds only to the extent of the legal documentation between us and any acquired
                        marketplace, along with this agreement, and you acknowledge specifically that the onus is on you
                        to confirm the validity of your fund, and that any understatement or misstatement in relation to
                        this is not a claim against us, and belongs with the counterparty of any prior user agreement to
                        which you agreed; to the extent that we are required to release funds from your Account to you, you
                        will become our unsecured creditor until such funds are paid to you; we are not acting as a trustee
                        or fiduciary with respect to such funds or payments; the amount of funds showing in your Account
                        is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit; funds may only loaded into your Account, or released
                        from your Account, by us and you must only use the mechanisms available on the Website to pay for,
                        or receive funds in respect of Seller Services; any refunds required to be processed in your favour
                        will be returned only to the source of the original deposit, and cannot be redirected to any other
                        payment source; we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account (including Milestone
                        Payments) in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide
                        in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account;
                        and we may commingle your funds with funds of other Users and our own funds and such commingled funds
                        could be used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we
                        will remain obliged to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this User Agreement.
                        <h3>18. Limits & Fraud Prevention</h3>
                        We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent. If we
                        become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a fraudulent
                        transaction, this will be reversed immediately.If those funds have already been released to you,
                        you must pay the funds into your Account.If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your
                        account, or take action against you to recover those funds. We may, in our sole discretion, place
                        a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:
                        we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or
                        all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject
                        to reversal or chargeback; we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;
                        we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or we are
                        required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies. If you are involved in a dispute,
                        we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the
                        amount of any potential liability.If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift the limit
                        on your funds and those funds may be released to you.If the dispute is not resolved in your favour,
                        we may remove the funds from your Account.We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances
                        where we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behaviour, while we investigate any such
                        matter.
                        <h3>19. Refunds</h3>
                        You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates
                        to a Milestone Payment or relates to fees or charges payable to us. If the amount the User has asked
                        to refund relates to: (1) a Milestone Payment, the Dispute Resolution Process may be followed; or
                        (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.
                        If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s)
                        that the User used to make the original payment to us. We may refund funds to Users irrespective
                        of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that
                        we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any
                        dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund
                        policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User
                        is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion,
                        that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback. You can
                        request a refund by using our customer support website or emailing us at
                        <a href="mailto:support@Hirefox.com">support@Hirefox.com</a>. Once you have made a milestone payment, you expressly agree to use the dispute
                        resolution process in this agreement, expressly agree to be bound by its ruling and expressly agree
                        not to initiate any chargeback request with your card issuer. If you initiate any chargeback request
                        or other “Request for Information” or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share
                        any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to
                        defeat any such chargeback request. If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your
                        credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double
                        recovery. If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you
                        have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks,
                        we may suspend, limit or close your Account.

                        <h3>20. Chargebacks</h3>
                        A chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that a User files with their card issuer or financial institution), and any
                        subsequent reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as
                        payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow such instructions. You acknowledge and
                        agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us
                        by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by
                        Buyers through the Website, as well as any processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us
                        on those chargebacks and reversals. You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you,
                        which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third
                        parties (such as payment processors). If you initiate any chargeback request or other “Request for
                        Information” or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information
                        in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback
                        request.
                        <h3>21. Inactive Accounts</h3>
                        User Accounts that have not been logged into for a period of time will incur a maintenance fee per month, until either the
                        account is closed or reactivated, for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing
                        hosting of the User's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, promotion of your profile
                        on the Website and elsewhere, provision of the HireMe service, file storage, message transmission,

                        the amount of the maintenance fee is set out in our schedule of Fees and Charges. We reserve the
                        right to close an Inactive Account. We reserve the right to close an account with nil or negative
                        funds.
                        <h3>22. Right to Refuse Service</h3>
                        We may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may close,
                        suspend or limit your access to your Account: if we determine that you have breached, or are acting
                        in breach of, this User Agreement; if you under - bid on any Project in an attempt to renegotiate
                        the actual price privately, to attempt to avoid fees; if we determine that you have infringed legal
                        rights (resulting in actual or potential claims), including infringing Intellectual Property Rights;
                        if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities; you
                        do not respond to account verification requests; you do not complete account verification when requested
                        within 3 months of the date of request; you are the subject of a United Nations, USAn, EU, USA or
                        other applicable sanctions regime, or our banking and payment relationships otherwise preclude us
                        from conducting business with you; to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person;
                        or for other reasons. If we close your Account due to your breach of this User Agreement, you may
                        also become liable for certain fees as described in this User Agreement. Without limiting our other
                        remedies, to the extent you have breached this User Agreement, you must pay us all fees owed to us
                        and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our employee time) and reasonable
                        expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees. You
                        acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this
                        User Agreement will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other
                        related expenses imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be
                        extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain; (2) if you breach this User Agreement, we may
                        take legal action against you to recover losses. If we close your Account for a reason other than
                        as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as otherwise specified in this User Agreement,
                        you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you. In the event that we close your Account,
                        you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of
                        your Account.

                        <h3>23. Other Disputes With Users</h3>
                        You acknowledge and agree that in the event that a dispute arises between you and another User in relation to any Project
                        that you will first attempt to resolve any differences that you have in relation to such Project,
                        including in relation to the quality of the services provided. If you continue to have any difficulties
                        or problems in relation to a dispute with another User in relation to a Project we encourage you
                        to contact us as set out in the Clause entitled "Contacting us". You agree that any dispute that
                        is not related to a Milestone Payment (which must be dealt with in accordance with the Milestone
                        Disputes Policy) arising between you and another User will be handled in accordance with this clause.
                        Hirefox will have full rights and powers to make a determination for all such disputes. Upon receipt
                        of a dispute, Hirefox shall have the right to request the Seller and the Buyer to provide documentation
                        in support of their claim or position in relation to the dispute. You agree that Hirefox has absolute
                        discretion to accept or reject any document provided. You also acknowledge that Hirefox is not a
                        judicial or alternative dispute resolution institution and that we will make the determinations only

                        so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly.We strongly
                        encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our customer support website or
                        emailing us at
                        <a href="mailto:support@Hirefox.com"> support@Hirefox.com </a>. For any claim, Hirefox may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective
                        manner through binding non - appearance - based arbitration.If Hirefox elects arbitration, such arbitration
                        will be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is
                        to be selected by you from a panel of ADR providers that Hirefox will provide to you.The ADR provider
                        and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone,
                        online and / or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the
                        party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by
                        the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on
                        the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. All claims
                        you bring against Hirefox must be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All claims
                        filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of
                        this Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to the terms of this Agreement, Hirefox may recover
                        its legal fees and costs (including in-house lawyers and paralegals), provided that Hirefox has notified
                        you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
                        You agree that you will not pursue any claims arising under this User Agreement on a class or other
                        representative basis and will not seek to coordinate or consolidate any arbitration or action hereunder
                        with any other proceeding. If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of
                        any bankruptcy or insolvency law, Hirefox will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses
                        (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this
                        Agreement. Hirefox’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our
                        right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
                        <h3>25. Currencies</h3>
                        Some of the Websites will display rates in the local currency of that Website, in addition to the actual amount. These rates
                        are based on a conversion from the originating currency using indicative market exchange rates. You
                        understand and agree that these rates are only indicative and the amount specified in the origin
                        currency is the actual amount. As a convenience service, you may withdraw funds from the Website
                        in another currency. If you wish to do so, you will be quoted an exchange rate which will be available
                        for the time specified, which you may choose to accept. We may charge a fee for effecting the currency
                        conversion transactions. This fee will be embedded within the rate provided to you and the currency
                        exchange will be settled immediately. We reserve the right to reject any request for a conversion
                        of currency at any time. You are responsible for all risks associated with converting and maintaining
                        funds in various available currencies, including but not limited to the risk that the value of these
                        funds will fluctuate as exchange rates change, which could result in decreases in the value of your
                        funds in aggregate. You must not use (or attempt to use) the Website to engage in speculative trading,
                        which could result in substantial losses. We are not a financial services provider. All information
                        included on the Website in respect of currency conversion is general information only. Use of currency
                        conversion is at your own risk. Currency conversions are final and irreversible.

                        out of or in any way related to such disputes and / or our Services.If you are a California resident,
                        you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release
                        does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor
                        at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected
                        his or her settlement with the debtor."
